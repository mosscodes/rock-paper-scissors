This is my version of the Rock Paper Scissors project from the Odin Project.

The game is written in javascript.

To play the game, open the index.html file in a web browser and open the console.

Type 'game()' in the console to begin. The game is 5 rounds and the winner is determined by whoever won the most amount of times within the 5 rounds. 

I plan on coming back and making a proper html and css interface at some point.
